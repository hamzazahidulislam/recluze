# Make a database from these results

## Download scopus result filter [Dcoment type = artcile, language = eng], select type [all information, export type = csv or execl & save as preferrence ], onother export type [all information, refrence manager ==> RIS (RefWorks), BibTex]. And check if the export limit is, then paginate the list to download.

## filter date range 2015-2026

##Abstruct & keyword check in to `word cloud` ==> Generating Word Cloud in Python

## This will help to write a systematic review.

## Note the date of the searching result for the future database update. And store the keyword or multiple keywords, additionally add the search type == Article, Abstract, Keywords.

## If your paper has an impact factor of more than 10. You will be eligible for a postdoc that pays more than a professor's wage. In China.

## China and Saudi Arabia author they're hot audience for you.

## You will be able to sell your scientific writing as a service on Upwork.

## every year i publish three review article. before doing systematic review we must retrieve scientific databases then we are replicate that process again for meta analysis.

## Check if EndNote can be provided freely by your university?

## Folder structure
