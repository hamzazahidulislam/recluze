# Levels of Measurement: A Statistical Hierarchy

This document outlines the four levels of measurement used in statistics to help determine which mathematical operations and statistical tests are appropriate for a given dataset.

## Table of Contents

1. [Nominal Level](#1-nominal-level-labels)
2. [Ordinal Level](#2-ordinal-level-order)
3. [Interval Level](#3-interval-level-fixed-spacing)
4. [Ratio Level](#4-ratio-level-the-gold-standard)
5. [Summary Comparison](#summary-comparison-table)

---

## 1. Nominal Level (Labels)

> **Definition:** Used for **categorizing** or labeling variables without any quantitative value or internal order. You can only calculate the _mode_ and _frequencies_.

- **Eye Color:** Brown, Blue, Green, Hazel.
- **Blood Type:** A, B, AB, O.
- **Marital Status:** Single, Married, Divorced, Widowed.
- **Binary Outcomes:** Yes/No, Pass/Fail.

---

## 2. Ordinal Level (Order)

> **Definition:** Data has a **specific order or rank**, but the "distance" between the ranks is unknown or inconsistent.

- **Satisfaction Surveys:** Very Unsatisfied, Neutral, Very Satisfied.
- **Socioeconomic Status:** Low income, Middle income, High income.
- **Race Results:** Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals. (The time gap between medals varies).
- **Education Level:** High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD.

---

## 3. Interval Level (Fixed Spacing)

> **Definition:** Data has a **meaningful order** and the **intervals between values are equal**. However, it lacks a "true zero"—zero is just a placeholder.

- **Temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit):** 20°C to 30°C is the same gap as 30°C to 40°C. 0°C doesn't mean "no heat."
- **IQ Scores:** The difference between 100 and 110 is the same as 110 and 120.
- **Dates:** The year 0 is a point in time, not the "absence of time."

---

## 4. Ratio Level (The "Gold Standard")

> **Definition:** Includes all properties of the previous levels plus a **true zero point**. This allows for statements like "twice as much" or "half as many."

- **Physical Dimensions:** Height, Weight, and Length. (0 kg = no weight).
- **Income:** $0 means no money earned.
- **Time:** Measured in seconds, minutes, or hours from a starting point.
- **Age:** Measured in years from the point of birth (0).

# Statistical Concepts: Triangulation

This document provides an overview of **Triangulation** in research and statistics, covering its types, advantages, and limitations.

---

## What is Triangulation?

**Triangulation** is the practice of using multiple methods, data sources, investigators, or theories to study a single phenomenon. By approaching a research question from different angles, researchers can cross-verify results and increase the reliability of their findings.

### Types of Triangulation

1. **Methodological:** Combining different methods (e.g., surveys + focus groups).
2. **Data:** Collecting data from different times, spaces, or persons.
3. **Investigator:** Using multiple researchers to observe and analyze the same data.
4. **Theoretical:** Using different theoretical perspectives to interpret a single set of data.

## Pros and Cons Analysis

### Advantages (Pros)

| Feature               | Benefit                                                                                            |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enhanced Validity** | Corroborating evidence from different sources makes the findings more credible.                    |
| **Rich Nuance**       | Provides a more complete picture (e.g., Quantitative shows _trends_, Qualitative shows _reasons_). |
| **Reduced Bias**      | Offsets the inherent weaknesses or biases of a single method or researcher.                        |
| **Discovery**         | Contradictions between data sources can lead to new, unexpected insights.                          |

### Disadvantages (Cons)

| Feature            | Drawback                                                                                 |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Cost**      | Requires more funding, tools, and participants than single-method studies.               |
| **Time-Consuming** | Data collection and analysis phases take significantly longer.                           |
| **Complexity**     | Integrating divergent data types (like numbers vs. text) can be technically difficult.   |
| **Conflict**       | Results may contradict each other, making it hard to form a single, cohesive conclusion. |

## Summary Checklist for Research

- [ ] Is the research question complex enough to require multiple methods?
- [ ] Do I have the resources (time/budget) for triangulation?
- [ ] Have I defined how I will reconcile conflicting data points?
- [ ] Are the chosen methods independent enough to provide a fresh perspective?
